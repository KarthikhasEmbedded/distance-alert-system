A Raspberry Pi Pico-based distance measurement and alert system using an ultrasonic sensor and buzzer.

# üìè Ultrasonic Distance Alert System

This project is a simple distance measurement and alert system using an **ultrasonic sensor** (HC-SR04) and a **buzzer**, built on the **Raspberry Pi Pico**. When an object comes closer than a preset distance (e.g., 30 cm), the buzzer is activated to warn the user.


# üîß Components Used #

- Raspberry Pi Pico
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Buzzer
- Breadboard & Jumper Wires
- Power Source (USB)
- Optional: LED (for visual alert)


# ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle #

- The **ultrasonic sensor** emits a sound wave and listens for the echo.
- The **time delay** is used to calculate the distance to the object.
- If the object is **closer than 30 cm**, the **buzzer turns ON**.
- If the object is farther away, the buzzer stays OFF.
